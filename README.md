# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
To Run This Project:-
Run this two commands in ternminal in VSCODE "cd dashboard" and "npm run dev".
I used React js and Material UI for this project.
I have done CRUD operations by using AXIOS library in react js.
We can view the list of users in table with pagignation.
